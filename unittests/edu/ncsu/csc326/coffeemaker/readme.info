All the unit tests were written with JUnitTest, and have @test annotation.
Since the tests were designed for JUnit5, a pom.xml file with the Maven Dependancies are included in this folder.

In order to run a test, you can open one of the ClassNameTest files, and then click on the 'bubble' in the margin, next to the method signature.

In order to run all the CoffeeMaker unit test, you should right click on the edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker package, and then select "Run 'Tests in 'edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker'' with Coverage"
